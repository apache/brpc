    // Differences between session-local and thread-local data
    // -------------------------------------------------------
    // * session-local data has to be got from a server-side Controller.
    //   thread-local data can be got in any function running inside a server
    //   thread without an object.
    // * session-local data is attached to current RPC and invalid after
    //   calling `done'. thread-local data is attached to current server
    //   thread and invalid after leaving Service::CallMethod(). If you need
    //   to hand down data to an asynchronous `done' which is called outside
    //   Service::CallMethod(), you must use session-local data.
    // -----------------
    // General guideline
    // -----------------
    // * Choose a proper value for reserved_xxx_local_data, small value may
    //   not create enough data for all searching threads, while big value
    //   wastes memory.
    // * Comparing to reserving data, making them as small as possible and
    //   creating them on demand is better. Passing a lot of stuff via
    //   session-local data or thread-local data is definitely not a good design.
