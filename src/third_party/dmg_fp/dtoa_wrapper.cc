 * This define and the code below is to trigger thread-safe behavior
 * in dtoa.cc, per this comment from the file:
 *
 * #define MULTIPLE_THREADS if the system offers preemptively scheduled
 *	multiple threads.  In this case, you must provide (or suitably
 *	#define) two locks, acquired by ACQUIRE_DTOA_LOCK(n) and freed
 *	by FREE_DTOA_LOCK(n) for n = 0 or 1.  (The second lock, accessed
 *	in pow5mult, ensures lazy evaluation of only one copy of high
 *	powers of 5; omitting this lock would introduce a small
 *	probability of wasting memory, but would otherwise be harmless.)
 *	You must also invoke freedtoa(s) to free the value s returned by
 *	dtoa.  You may do so whether or not MULTIPLE_THREADS is #defined.
