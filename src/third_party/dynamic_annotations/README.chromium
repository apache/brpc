One header and one source file (dynamic_annotations.h and dynamic_annotations.c)
in this directory define runtime macros useful for annotating synchronization
utilities and benign data races so data race detectors can handle Chromium code
with better precision.

These files were taken from
http://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/source/browse/?#svn/trunk/dynamic_annotations
