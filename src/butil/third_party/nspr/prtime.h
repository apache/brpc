/*
 * PRTime --
 *
 *     NSPR represents basic time as 64-bit signed integers relative
 *     to midnight (00:00:00), January 1, 1970 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
 *     (GMT is also known as Coordinated Universal Time, UTC.)
 *     The units of time are in microseconds. Negative times are allowed
 *     to represent times prior to the January 1970 epoch. Such values are
 *     intended to be exported to other systems or converted to human
 *     readable form.
 *
 *     Notes on porting: PRTime corresponds to time_t in ANSI C.  NSPR 1.0
 *     simply uses PRInt64.

 * PRExplodedTime --
 *
 *     Time broken down into human-readable components such as year, month,
 *     day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond.  Time zone and daylight
 *     saving time corrections may be applied.  If they are applied, the
 *     offsets from the GMT must be saved in the 'tm_params' field so that
 *     all the information is available to reconstruct GMT.
 *
 *     Notes on porting: PRExplodedTime corrresponds to struct tm in
 *     ANSI C, with the following differences:
 *       - an additional field tm_usec;
 *       - replacing tm_isdst by tm_params;
 *       - the month field is spelled tm_month, not tm_mon;
 *       - we use absolute year, AD, not the year since 1900.

 * PRTimeParamFn --
 *
 *     A function of PRTimeParamFn type returns the time zone and
 *     daylight saving time corrections for some geographic location,
 *     given the current time in GMT.  The input argument gmt should
 *     point to a PRExplodedTime that is in GMT, i.e., whose
 *     tm_params contains all 0's.
 *
 *     For any time zone other than GMT, the computation is intended to
 *     consist of two steps:
 *       - Figure out the time zone correction, tp_gmt_offset.  This number
 *         usually depends on the geographic location only.  But it may
 *         also depend on the current time.  For example, all of China
 *         is one time zone right now.  But this situation may change
 *         in the future.
 *       - Figure out the daylight saving time correction, tp_dst_offset.
 *         This number depends on both the geographic location and the
 *         current time.  Most of the DST rules are expressed in local
 *         current time.  If so, one should apply the time zone correction
 *         to GMT before applying the DST rules.
