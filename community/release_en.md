brpc apache release guide step by step
===

Overview: divided into the following steps

1. Preparation: including generating the key required for signature, creating github release branch and tag, modifying the version file, etc
2. Publish software package: including making source tarball, signing, uploading to the designated location and verifying
3. Vote: including voting in mail group `dev@brpc.apache.org` and `general@incubator.apache.org`
4. Release announcement: including updating brpc website, sending announcement emails, posting WeChat official account announcements, merging the release branche into the master branch

# Prepare key

## 1. Install GPG
Download the installation package from [GnuPG official website](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html). The commands of GnuPG version 1.x and version 2.x are slightly different. The following instructions take the `GnuPG-2.3.1` version (OSX) as an example.

After the installation is complete, execute the following command to check the version number.
```bash
gpg --version
```

## 2. Create key

After the installation is complete, execute the following command to create a key.

```bash
gpg --full-gen-key
```

Complete the key creation according to the prompts. Note that the mailbox should use the Apache email address, and the `Real Name` can use Apache ID or GitHub ID:

```
gpg (GnuPG) 2.3.1; Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: LorinLee
Email address: lorinlee@apache.org
Comment: lorinlee's key
You selected this USER-ID:
    "LorinLee (lorinlee's key) <lorinlee@apache.org>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key. # Input password

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
gpg: key 92E18A11B6585834 marked as ultimately trusted
gpg: revocation certificate stored as '/Users/lilei/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/C30F211F071894258497F46392E18A11B6585834.rev'
public and secret key created and signed.

pub   rsa4096 2021-10-17 [SC]
      C30F211F071894258497F46392E18A11B6585834

sub   rsa4096 2021-10-17 [E]
```

## 3. Check the generated key

```bash
gpg --list-keys
```

output:

```
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
gpg: depth: 0  valid:   2  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 2u

----------------------------------
pub   rsa4096 2021-10-17 [SC]
      C30F211F071894258497F46392E18A11B6585834
uid           [ultimate] LorinLee (lorinlee's key) <lorinlee@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096 2021-10-17 [E]
```

Note that `C30F211F071894258497F46392E18A11B6585834` is the public key.

## 4. Publish the public key to server

Execute the following command:

```bash
gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --send-key C30F211F071894258497F46392E18A11B6585834
```

## 5. Generate fingerprint and upload to apache user profile

Since the public key server has no verifying mechanism, anyone can upload the public key in your name, so there is no way to guarantee the reliability of the public key on the server. Usually, you can publish a public key fingerprint on your website and let others check the downloaded public key.

Execute the following command to view the fingerprint.
```
gpg --fingerprint lorinlee # user id
```

output: 
```
/Users/lilei/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
----------------------------------
pub   rsa4096 2021-10-17 [SC]
      C30F 211F 0718 9425 8497  F463 92E1 8A11 B658 5834
uid           [ultimate] LorinLee (lorinlee's key) <lorinlee@apache.org>
sub   rsa4096 2021-10-17 [E]
```

Paste the above fingerprint `C30F 211F 0718 9425 8497 F463 92E1 8A11 B658 5834` into the `OpenPGP Public Key Primary Fingerprint:` field of your Apache user information on https://id.apache.org.

# Prepare release package

## 1. Create release branch

If you are releasing a new MINOR version, like `1.0.0`, you need to create a new branch `release-1.0` from master.

If you are releasing a new PATCH version from existing MINOR version, like `1.0.1`, you only need to modify the existing `release-1.0` branch and add the content to be released.

The code modification during the release process are performed on the release branch (such as `release-1.0`). After the release is complete, please merge the release branch back into the master branch.

## 2. Update version in source code

### Update RELEASE_VERSION file

Edit the `RELEASE_VERSION` file in the project root directory, update the version number, and submit it to the code repository. For example, the `1.0.0` version of the file is:

```
1.0.0
```

### Update CMakeLists.txt file
Edit the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the project root directory, update the version number, and submit it to the code repository. For example: 

```
set(BRPC_VERSION 1.0.0)
```

### Update /package/rpm/brpc.spec file
Edit the `/package/rpm/brpc.spec` file in the project root directory, update the version number, and submit it to the code repository. For example: 

```
Version:	1.0.0
```

## 3. Create releasing tag

push the release branch to tag, For example:

```bash
git clone -b release-1.0 git@github.com:apache/brpc.git ~/brpc

cd ~/brpc

git tag -a 1.0.0 -m "release 1.0.0"

git push origin --tags
```

## 4. Create releasing package

```bash
git archive --format=tar 1.0.0 --prefix=apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src/ | gzip > apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz
```

## 5. Generate GPG signature

```bash
gpg -u lorinlee@apache.org --armor --output apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc --detach-sign apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz

gpg --verify apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz

```

## 6. Generate SHA512 sum

```bash
sha512sum apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz > apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512

sha512sum --check apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512
```

# Publish to Apache SVN repository

## 1. checkout dist/dev/brpc directory

If there is no local working directory, create a local working directory first. Clone the Apache SVN repository, username needs to use your own Apache LDAP username:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/brpc_svn/dev/

cd ~/brpc_svn/dev/

svn --username=lorinlee co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/brpc/

cd ~/brpc_svn/dev/brpc
```

## 2. Add GPG public key

A new release manager must add the key into KEYS file for the first time.

```
(gpg --list-sigs lorinlee && gpg -a --export lorinlee) >> KEYS
```

## 3. Add the releasing package to SVN directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/brpc_svn/dev/brpc/1.0.0

cd ~/brpc_svn/dev/brpc/1.0.0

cp ~/brpc/apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz ~/brpc_svn/dev/brpc/1.0.0

cp ~/brpc/apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc ~/brpc_svn/dev/brpc/1.0.0

cp ~/brpc/apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512 ~/brpc_svn/dev/brpc/1.0.0
```

## 4. Submit SVN

Return to the parent directory and use the Apache LDAP account to submit SVN

```bash
cd ~/brpc_svn/dev/brpc

svn add *

svn --username=lorinlee commit -m "release 1.0.0"
```

# Verify release

## 1. Verify SHA512 sum

```bash
sha512sum --check apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha512
```

## 2. Verify GPG signature

First import the publisher's public key. Import KEYS from the svn repository to the local. (The person who releases the version does not need to import it again. The person who verify needs to import it.)

```bash
curl https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/brpc/KEYS >> KEYS

gpg --import KEYS
```

Trust the signature of publisher, execute the following command using the publisher's user name

```bash
gpg --edit-key lorinlee
```

output:
```
gpg (GnuPG) 2.3.1; Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.

Secret key is available.

gpg> trust

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly verify other users' keys
(by looking at passports, checking fingerprints from different sources, etc.)

  1 = I don't know or won't say
  2 = I do NOT trust
  3 = I trust marginally
  4 = I trust fully
  5 = I trust ultimately
  m = back to the main menu

Your decision? 5
Do you really want to set this key to ultimate trust? (y/N) y

gpg> save
```

Then verify the GPG signature:
```
gpg --verify apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz
```

## 3. Check release content

### 1. Compare the difference of between the source code package and github tag

```bash
curl -Lo tag-1.0.0.tar.gz https://github.com/apache/brpc/archive/refs/tags/1.0.0.tar.gz

tar xvzf tag-1.0.0.tar.gz

tar xvzf apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src.tar.gz

diff -r brpc-1.0.0 apache-brpc-1.0.0-incubating-src
```

### 2. Check file content

- Check whether the source code package contains unnecessary files, which makes the tarball too large
- LICENSE and NOTICE files exist
- The year in the NOTICE file is correct
- Only text files exist, no binary files exist
- All files have an ASF license at the beginning
- Source code can be compiled correctly, and the unit test can pass
- Check whether there are redundant files or folders, such as empty folders
- Check for third-party dependency licenses:
   - Third party dependency license compatibility
   - All licenses of third-party dependency are declared in the LICENSE file
   - The complete version of the dependency license is in the license directory
   - If third-party dependency have the Apache license and have NOTICE files, these NOTICE files also need to be added to the releasing NOTICE file
