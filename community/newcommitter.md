## Suggested steps from secretary@apache.org
Please do these things:

1. Hold the discussion and vote on your private@ list. This avoids any issues related to personnel, which should remain private.
2. If the vote is successful, announce the result to the private@ list with a new email thread with subject [RESULT][VOTE]. This makes it easier for secretary to find the result of the vote in order to request the account at the time of the filing of the ICLA.
3. Only if the candidate accepts committership, announce the new committer on your dev@ list.

Doing these things will make everyone's job easier.
