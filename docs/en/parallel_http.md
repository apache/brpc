Parallel_http can access a large number of http services (tens of thousands) at the same time, and is suitable for querying the built-in information of all online servers on the command line for further filtering and aggregation by other tools. It is difficult for curl to do this. Even if multiple curls are running in the background, the parallelism is generally only about 100, and it takes a very long time to access tens of thousands of machines.
