# About Builtin Services

Builtin services expose internal status of servers, making development and debugging more efficient over brpc. brpc serves builting services via `HTTP`, which can be easily accessed through curl and browsers.  Servers respond *plain text* or *html* according to `User-Agent` in the request header, or you can append `?console=1` to the *uri* which forces servers to respond *plain text*. Here's an [example](http://brpc.baidu.com:8765/) running on our machine, check it out for more information about the builtin services. If the listen port is filtered(e.g. only ports in *8000-8999* can be accessed outside data centers in Baidu), you can run [rpc_view](rpc_view.md) to launch a proxy or run `curl \<SERVER-URL\>` inside data centers.

# Safe Mode

To stay safe from attack, you **must** disable builtin services in the servers on public network, including the ones accessed by proxies(nginx or other http servers). Click [here](../cn/server.md#安全模式) for more details.
