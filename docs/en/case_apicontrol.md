| 8.11-8.28 | Research + R&D + Self-test | See the attachment for the self-test performance report |
| 9.8-9.22 | QA test | QA test report see attachment |
| 10.8 | 1 machine in Beijing computer room goes online | |
| 10.14 | One machine in Beijing computer room goes online | Fix URL encoding problem |
| 10.19 | Beijing computer room 7/35 machines go online, 2 machines in Hangzhou and Nanjing each go online | Start small traffic online |
| 10.22 | Beijing computer room 10/35 machine online Hangzhou computer room 5/26 machine online Nanjing computer room 5/19 machine online | fix http response data compression problem |
| 11.3 | Beijing computer room 10/35 machine online | Fix RPC memory leak problem |
| 11.6 | Hangzhou computer room 5/26 machine online, Nanjing computer room 5/19 machine online | same as Beijing computer room version |
| 11.9 | Beijing computer room is online with full data | |

Up to now, the performance of online services has been stable.

# QA test conclusion

1. [Performance test] Single machine supports maximum QPS: **9000+**. It can effectively solve the problem of a slow service in the original hulu_pbrpc that drags down all services. The performance is very good.
2. [Stability Test] There is no problem with the long-term pressure test.

QA test conclusion: passed

# Performance improvement real-time statistics

Statistics time 2015.11.3 15:00 â€“ 2015.11.9 14:30, a total of **143.5** hours (nearly 6 days) of uninterrupted operation. Noah monitoring data of 12 machines in the same machine room before and after the upgrade in the Beijing machine room.
